## Eligible Refund Cases

You may be eligible for a refund if:

- **Product was defective**: If the delivered credentials are invalid, expired, or non-functional at the time of delivery.
- **Duplicate purchase**: If you accidentally purchased the same product twice.

## Non-Eligible Cases

Refunds will **not** be issued for:

- Credentials that were successfully delivered and viewed.
- Change of mind after viewing the credentials.
- Issues arising from your own misuse or sharing of credentials.
- Account suspensions or bans resulting from violations of the service provider's terms.
