# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I receive my purchase?

After your payment is confirmed, you will receive a unique, one-time secure link to view your credentials. This link expires after 48 hours and can only be viewed once for security purposes.

## How long does delivery take?

For automated payment methods, delivery is instant. For manual bank transfers, delivery occurs after the admin verifies your payment, typically within a few hours.

## Can I get a refund?

Please see our [Refund Policy](/refund-policy) for details. Generally, due to the digital nature of our products, refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis.

## Is it safe to buy here?

Yes. All credentials are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM encryption and delivered through secure, one-time-use links. We never send credentials via email.

## I lost my delivery link. What do I do?

You can look up your order using the order code sent to your email. If the delivery link has expired and you haven't viewed it, contact us for assistance.
